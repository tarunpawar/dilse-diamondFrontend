Whenever my fiance shows off her ring, which she loves to show off, she doesn't get an "Oh, pretty" or "How cute." Instead, there is a loud gasp followed by "Oh My God!" In fact, when I was proposing, she didn't just say, "Yes." She screamed, "HOLY ****! Is that real?!" followed by a "YES!!!" And that, my friends, is the response you want to get from an engagement ring. I ring-shopped for over a year. I looked at thousands of diamonds, bands, visited jewelers, websites, etc. I compared them all and found the best band (platinum with diamonds) and best diamond (3+ carat) at the best price through Dilse Jewels. They delivered exactly what they promised and exactly what I was looking for — a ring with a HUGE gorgeous diamond that sparkles so bright you can see it across the room. I love that my fiance loves this ring. And Dilse Jewels made it easy — they answered all of my questions and provided fantastic customer service. So if you're ring shopping, Dilse Jewels is the one to go with. Honestly, they cannot be beat.`,
