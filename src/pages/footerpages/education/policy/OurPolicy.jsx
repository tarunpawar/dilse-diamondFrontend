                  Conflict diamonds are gems which are obtained in association with human rights abuses, child labor, violence, or severe environmental damage. In the 1990s, many of the world's diamonds came from Africa, particularly regions undergoing civil unrest. Rebel armies in parts of Africa were exploiting alluvial diamond fields to fund their wars against established governments, putting people and the environment in the middle of their conflicts. Diamonds obtained as a result of these activities are called conflict diamonds.

                  Adopted in December 2000 by the United Nations General Assembly, this landmark resolution created an international certification process for rough diamonds. A coalition of governments, non-governmental organizations, and the diamond industry established the Kimberley Process to control the export and import of rough diamonds to eliminate the trade in conflict diamonds. The Kimberley Process has stringent requirements on its members to allow them to certify shipments of rough diamonds as “conflict-free.” The Kimberley Process has already been immensely successful, and continues to strengthen its objectives and controls. Today apart from countries like Canada, many African countries supply diamonds that are conflict free and are used to uplift the economy and create a long-term positive impact for people who are employed by mines.

                  The most recent influx of conflict diamonds has been from mining in Zimbabwe’s Marange diamond fields. Due to reports of human rights abuses, With Clarity does not purchase or inventory any diamonds that are associated or affiliated with Zimbabwean mining. With Clarity employs trained experts who can identify Zimbabwean diamonds that are in circulation, further ensuring our responsibility in purchasing and sourcing diamonds. With Clarity regularly reviews and improves its conflict diamond and environmental safety standards.

                  When measuring your finger, a ring should fit snug and comfortably. The most accurate way to find a good fit is by using a ring sizer or having a jeweler measure your finger. Alternatively, have a jeweler measure a ring that is worn on the ring finger to determine the ring size. Fingers may slightly swell in warm weather, so be sure to choose a size that fits comfortably over the knuckle and does not fall off when moving your hand. We’re happy to create rings in quarter sizes and in-between sizes to ensure we can craft the perfect fit.

                  With Clarity recognizes that ring sizing is not a perfect science. To this end, we offer one free resizing within 30 days of your purchase for all orders shipped within the USA, UK, Canada & Australia. For orders shipping to and from USA addresses, there is a $25 one way FedEx insured shipping fee that applies (complimentary return shipping). For orders shipping to and from UK & Canada addresses, there is a $30 roundtrip insured FedEx shipping fee that applies (complimentary return shipping). For orders shipping to and from Australia addresses, there is a $40 roundtrip insured FedEx shipping fee that applies (complimentary return shipping). Any resizing up will not be subject to additional metal charges. During the resize process small amounts of metal will be added or removed to increase or decrease the size to adjust for the new size needed. As a result, your ring may be slightly thicker or thinner when completed. Please be aware that a resizing down may result in a slight reduction in metal weight, which cannot be reimbursed.

                  We request up to 1 week to perform a resizing, excluding shipping days. Please Note: Eternity rings cannot be resized or exchanged outside our 30-day return policy.

                  Any resizing request outside 30 days will be subject to fees, including shipping and resizing fees. In most cases, subject to With Clarity's discretion, a ring resizing under 1 US finger size will be accompanied by shipping charges plus $30 for 14kt gold, $40 for 18kt gold and $50 for platinum. For resizing above or below 1 finger size, a new ring will need to be re-crafted to preserve the quality and structural integrity of the jewelry. In such instances, please contact our team for a quotation.      </div>
