            Gemstone and diamond jewelry can be paired with a variety of
            precious metals. The metal you choose can depend on your preference
            in durability, look and cost. Factors that set different types of
            metals apart are also the luster (shine), weight and color of the
            metal. With Clarity crafts jewelry using gold and platinum. We are
            also committed to using eco-friendly sources of metal. These are
            among the most durable and visually appealing metals, and are most
            commonly used in crafting jewelry. These metals are classified as
            precious as they are more rare and expensive than other commonly
            used metals.

              A large portion of jewelry is forged with gold and this has been
              the case for centuries. Gold offers versatility in hue. It is
              available in white, yellow, and rose shades most commonly. White
              gold is a great match with all gemstones and diamond and offers a
              versatile shine. Yellow gold is more traditional and pairs well
              with colored gemstones as well as diamonds. Finally, rose gold is
              a striking pink hue, a trendy and unique choice.

              A precious metal, platinum is more expensive and rare than gold.
              Platinum has a silvery white hue and is known for durability.
              Platinum is often chosen for it’s ability to resist abrasion or
              scratches. This fine metal pairs well with any gemstone or
              diamond. It is best used for jewelry like rings and wedding bands
              and pieces that will be worn regularly.

        <div className="mb-4 alloy-text">
          <p>
            We all take for granted the fact that we are able to purchase
            jewelry whenever we want, and the ability to choose the metal we
            would like on our rings. We seldom take thought of the metal that is
            used to make our rings as it is just there for us to choose. A lot
            of work goes into the manufacturing of Gold rings, as there are
            different alloys and different metals that are used in their
            manufacturing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alloys are metals that have been mixed with other elements to
            increase their strength and resist corrosion. Alloy is used because
            the properties that are found in metal are inadequate for some types
            of jobs. Iron can be a great material to use for building, but
            steel, (which is an alloy that is made with carbon and non-metallic
            material mixed together), is a harder, stronger and more rust-proof
            metal. Aluminum is light, but also soft in its purest form. Some of
            the metals that are usually used with gold as alloys to make jewelry
            are copper, iron, nickel, silver, tin, zinc, cadmium, titanium and
            manganese.
          </p>
          <p>
            These alloys not only increase the strength of the gold, but also
            work in changing some other properties of gold. Some gold engagement
            rings cause a dark stain on the finger of the person wearing it and
            some cause allergic reactions, such as rashes and blisters. Because
            of the versatility of gold, it is very popular. Gold can be used to
            make many different shapes; if it is 18k or above, it will not get
            tarnished and will not cause irritation. White gold engagement
            rings, (or rings from gold that has been made with light materials
            and plated with rhodium), is a popular choice over a platinum
            engagement ring, because of its appearance and cost. It is
            categorized as platinum, and after silver, it is the whitest
            precious metal.

          Advantages/Disadvantages of using different gold alloys for jewelry
        </h2>

        <div className="row gy-4 alloy-text">
          <p>
            18k yellow gold: Consists of 75% gold that is alloyed with silver,
            zinc, cobalt and copper, they have a richer look and feel than other
            metals used in the manufacturing of yellow gold engagement rings.
            18k gold is not plated, is very malleable, and will, in few
            circumstances, cause skin irritation. Some of the disadvantages are
            that unlike other jewelry that has a lower level purity alloy; it is
            less scratch-resistant. It also takes years to wear down, even with
            heavy wear.
          </p>
          <p>
            White Gold: With white gold, which is also 75% gold with copper,
            palladium, zinc and nickel alloys, it is a whitish metal, which can
            be used in place of Platinum engagement rings, if it has rhodium
            plating. White gold, or platinum rings, has a higher resistance than
            18k yellow gold, to bending, or scratching. They possess high
            density and are very solid and can be very workable. On the other
            hand, for white gold, or platinum to have a high luster, it will
            require rhodium plating. If the wearer has an allergy to nickel,
            then it will cause an irritation and takes a long time to wear down.
          </p>
          <p>
            18k Palladium white gold: Consists of 75% gold and only 25%
            palladium. This metal can also be substituted for engagement ring
            platinum, as the metal is whitish and resembles platinum when it is
            plated with rhodium. It does not often cause skin irritation, if
            ever. It is workable and possesses a high density and is also very
            solid. The disadvantages are that it has to be plated with rhodium,
            will wear down, even if it is over a period of time, and costs more
            than 18k nickel alloy. When it comes to a choice of white gold vs.
            platinum
          </p>
          <p>
            4K yellow or white gold: Last, but not least, is the 14k yellow or
            white gold, which is the most popular of the four. 14k gold is
            stamped for identification purposes, possesses a mixture of 58% of
            the purest gold with a make-up of other metals, such as silver,
            nickel, copper, and zinc, amounting to 42% and is identified by the
            “14k” stamped on the link or lock. 14k gold requires no plating, is
            heavily resistant to bending or scratching and will not, in many
            cases, cause skin irritation. It is more cost effective that
            platinum alloys, or 18k gold, but is somewhat lighter than the 18k
            gold. It is more difficult to work with and is less resistant than
            its 18k counterpart.

            <p>
              When it comes to precious metals, there is a distinct difference
              between their hardness and their strength. Hardness, or HV, is how
              scratch resistant the metal is when the surface is pierced with a
              pointed object that has load and gauging penetration. Hardness and
              scratch resistance is measured with the Vickers Hardness scale.
              Durability, or PSI, is measured by the pounds in each square inch
              and is tested when the tensile strength is measured for overall
              durability with pressure that could break the material.

              Platinum is normally marked with a PLAT, or “950pt.” if a ring
              contains 90% platinum it is hard and marked as 900pt, while if it
              is 50-90% it is marked PLAT and has no indicator of purity. Alloys
              which contain less than 50% of platinum is not marked based on FTC
              rules. The highest temperature for melting platinum is 950 parts
              platinum with 50 parts ruthenium, so it is hard to cast, while it
              is a darker gray than platinum mixed with iridium.
            </p>
            <p>
              Setters recommend that this be used on diamond jewelry only, as
              diamonds require more pressure when they are being set. PT950/ru
              is extremely hard and as a result, more resistant to wear and tear
              over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              PT 900 and 950/Ir are hard and medium alloys; one is relatively
              hard and the other malleable. Both are white and soft, so they are
              both great with handmade jewelry. The softer the metal, the longer
              the polishing process, but they are both more scratch and bend
              resistant than alloys that are harder. They also hold the stones
              better in the event of an impact and are both resistant to wear
              and tear. Platinum mixed with 50 parts cobalt (PT950/Co), is also
              somewhat hard. It is great for making fine jewelry and also for
              filigree jewelry. Great craftsmanship is as critical in the
              process as the material, but there is no alloy for platinum is
              better than any other.
