                <p>
                  Product data and pricing information, are updated regularly to
                  represent the most current or up to date information available
                  to us. Occasionally, product and pricing information may be
                  inaccurately displayed or represented on our site or by our
                  representatives/employees due to typographical, system, or
                  other errors. We make every effort to avoid such errors. We
                  reserve the right to correct any and all pricing and product
                  information errors. In the occasion that such an error does
                  occur, Dilsejewels does not honor erroneous pricing or
                  product information. In the event of an error or
                  misrepresentation, we will employ our best efforts to notify
                  you via email or telephone. If the error is discovered prior
                  to shipment of a product sold on Dilsejewels, we will
                  notify you, cancel the order and provide accurate product and
                  pricing information. Dilsejewels reserves the right to
                  cancel an order for any reason such as pricing errors, failure
                  to receive timely payments or any use or cause deemed
                  appropriate or necessary by Dilsejewels. If the order has
                  already shipped, we will require that you return the
                  product(s) unused, pay the difference between the actual and
                  charged price or purchase an alternative product(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our product prices and availability are subject to change
                  without notice. If a product is no longer available because it
                  was sold, inaccurately represented or it was not updated at
                  the time of your order in our system, we will notify you
                  accordingly and offer a similar product(s). If an product of
                  interest is no longer available, please contact us and we can
                  let you know when the product or a similar product will be
                  available. We apologize in advance for any issues or
                  inconveniences this may cause.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Orders created with bank wire transfer are only confirmed or
                  deemed valid orders once a payment is made and received by The
                  Carat Casa. Diamonds are placed on hold for a period of no
                  more than 24 hours after the bank wire order is created.
                  Diamonds are then made available to other customers for
                  purchase or sale.
                </p>
                <h2 className="display-12">Product Returns</h2>

                  30 calendar days of receipt of products. Orders are considered
                  final sale after 30 days from receiving the order, as verified
                  by the official FedEx tracking information. Returns must be
                  made in the original condition in which the item was received.
                  All returns are subject to inspection of returned items, help

                  period. Any subsequent sales are final and the 30-day return

                <p>
                  Dilsejewels makes all reasonable efforts to display the
                  products listed for sale on its website(s) as accurately as
                  possible. However, the colors we use, as well as the display
                  and color capabilities of your computer monitor, will affect
                  the colors that you actually see on your screen. The Carat
                  Casa cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any
                  product color, texture or detail will be accurate. All The
                  Carat Casa product displays and images are intended
                  representations and may contain inaccuracies that differ from
                  saleable products. Dilsejewels may improve the quality of
                  its products occasionally, which may not be represented in its
                  on-site product descriptions. In addition, Dilsejewels does
                  not warrant that product descriptions or other content are
                  accurate, complete, reliable current or error-free. While The
                  Carat Casa makes every effort to ensure that our products are
                  described and priced accurately, in the event that an item is
                  deemed to be priced incorrectly, Dilsejewels reserves the
                  right to refuse sale that item.

                  Please note that for all engagement rings with a lab grown
                  diamond center, all accent diamonds set within that engagement
                  ring will be lab accent diamonds. For an engagement ring with
                  a natural diamond center, all accent diamonds set within that
                  ring will be natural accent diamonds. Accent diamonds are
                  chosen to match each other and the center diamond.

                  Diamond and Gemstone carat total weight may vary 10-20% from
                  stated weight. Color and clarity grades are expressed as a
                  minimum. In some cases, we list the minimum color and clarity
                  of both the center diamond and the side diamonds. These
                  details can be found in the product details of the item on the

                  A customer may only place one diamond ring or loose diamond
                  order at a time. If multiple orders of a similar product
                  category are placed, we reserve the right to cancel one order.
                  Our team will make efforts to contact the customer prior to
                  cancellation. If in the event two orders are placed and
                  fulfilled, one will be eligible for return and the other will
                  be final sale and not eligible for exchange.&nbsp;

                    to a $100.00 per home preview ring charge as authorization
                    and verification of customer billing information. This

                    All replica rings mimic Dilsejewels engagement rings and
                    may vary slightly from the final product. Each ring is a
                    silver-based metallic alloy and all center and accent
                    gemstones are diamond simulants. Replica rings are intended
                    for visual purposes, not extended wear, which may result in
                    damage or tarnish. Replica alloys are not hypoallergenic and
                    can cause an allergic reaction from extended wear.
